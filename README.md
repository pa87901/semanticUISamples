# A brief introduction to Semantic UI

## Introduction
This repository introduces some elements available in the Semantic UI library.
For the official documentation please visit one of the below links.
Semantic UI: https://semantic-ui.com
Semantic UI for React: https://react.semantic-ui.com



## Getting started

### Installing dependencies
After cloning this repository, run
```
npm install
```
This will install the Semantic UI library - listed as a dependency in `package.json`.

### Opening the file
Then simply open the `index.html` file to interact with the listed elements.
The `index.html` already contains a script that points to the jQuery library online. If you need to run `index.html` offline, install the jQuery library to your local repo.
